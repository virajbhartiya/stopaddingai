# STOP ADDING AI

A website that will slap the AI-obsession right out of your product roadmap. Inspired by the "take no prisoners" approach of [justfuckingusehtml.com](https://justfuckingusehtml.com) but focused on stopping you from shoving AI where it doesn't belong.

## WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

"Stop Adding AI" is your intervention. Your wake-up call. Your friend who tells you that you look ridiculous in that outfit before you leave the house. We're here to remind you that not every goddamn product needs artificial intelligence, and most things are actually worse with it.

## HOW TO USE THIS SITE, YOU GENIUS

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Read the damn content
3. Stop adding AI to everything
4. That's it, seriously

## DEVELOPMENT (NO AI REQUIRED)

Built with pure HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. No frameworks, no libraries, no machine learning models predicting what you want to see next - just the web as it should be.

To modify (if you must):

1. Edit `index.html` like a normal person
2. The styles are in the `<style>` section because we're not making HTTP requests for 2KB of CSS
3. The JavaScript is so minimal it fits in a single script tag - the way god intended

Use this however you want to fight the good fight against unnecessary AI. Just don't use AI to do it, that would be painfully ironic.
